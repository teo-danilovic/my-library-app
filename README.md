o	"As a book lover, I want to remove a book from my collection if I no longer own it or want to track it, so that my collection is up-to-date."

o	"As a book lover, I want to view the reading history for a specific book so I can monitor my reading engagement and recall my thoughts on it."

Overall Function of the App:
The "myLibrary" application functions as a digital catalog and management tool for book lovers or readers.
Its main purposes are to:
1.	Maintain a Database of Books: Allow users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) entries for individual books, storing details like title, author, genre, publication year, and reading status (e.g., to-read, reading, read).
2.	Track Reading Progress: Enable users to log and view reading sessions or progress (date started, date finished, current page, personal rating, notes) for each book.
3.	Manage a Tag Inventory (or Custom Lists): Allow users to maintain a list of tags (CRUD operations for tags).
4.	Link Tags to Books: Provide a way to associate specific tags from the inventory with particular books, indicating which books belong to which tags (a many-to-many relationship).
Essentially, it's a hobbyist application for people who want to keep detailed records about their books, their reading habits, and how they categorize them.

## Technologies used: 

Python
Django
HTML
CSS
Materialize CSS (A specific CSS framework (based on Material Design) that I use for pre-built UI components and styling (like cards, buttons, forms, navbar).
Vanilla JavaScript (for DOM manipulation): My custom script block uses basic JavaScript to initialize Materialize components (DOMContentLoaded, querySelectorAll, M.Datepicker.init, etc.).
PostgreSQL


## Next steps / Stretch goals:


- Allow for public profiles (optional and privacy-aware)
- Allow to search for books based off of tags various people have given them (once profiles are public)
- Friend system - allow users to connect with people whose reading lists they like and want to follow
- Allow for comments on each others profiles about books
- Add more styling and design to the App - fonts, background images, gifs, etc.
